        <p>
          I was born in Utica, NY and raised in Knoxville, TN. I began my academic career as an Engineering student at the Univerity of Tennessee but being deeply involved in a musical project I switched my major to jazz studies and began playing and teaching in and around the southeastern US. Over the next 10 years I played in a variety of projects from progressive rock and jazz to funk and rap. During this time I worked as a Producer, Stage Manager, and Production Assistant working for over 100 artists including Neil Young, Diana Ross, and Phish.

          In 2012 I decided to make a career change and entered the world of video production. Over the course of 5 years I worked my way up from Assistant Camera to Camera Operator and then to Second Unit Director and Director of Photography. Our crews produced shows for Discovery, Oxygen, TVOne, and Hallmark. We also made several commercials for a wide range of clients from US Cellular to Dollywood. In 2016 and 2017 I worked as a Camera Operator and Director of Photography for Scripps Network Interactive (HGTV, FoodNetwork).

          Then in 2016, like many that year, I was bitten by the VR bug. Thoroughly impressed with the possibilities of emmersive media I devoted myself to studying once again. I began by trading guitar lessons for coding lessons with an Software Engineer at Cisco and proceeded to complete several courses from Harvard's CS50 and The Complete Unity Developer to Blender Bootcamp and Zenva's VR Mini Degree. I am currently living in the NYC area and developing multiple VR projects for Autotelix.
