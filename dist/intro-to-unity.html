                In 2020, I was hired as an adjunct professor for Brookdale
                College in New Jersey to create and instruct a brand new class
                for their game design program, Intro to Unity. Over the 15 week
                semester I took students, who were not required to have any
                prior experience with coding or Unity, through an in depth study
                of what’s possible in game development. My students not only
                learned the ins and outs of the Unity editor but were challenged
                to be creative and develop a project of their choosing for their
                final task. I plan to keep developing the course and teach it
                again in the semesters to come.

                The first unit of Intro to Unity focuses on fundamentals such as
                the Unity editor windows, beginning c# scripting, player input /
                movement, item collection, the UI canvas, and scene management.
                We start with the classic tutorial “Roll a Ball”, the Hello
                World of Unity dev, and grow that project into an original 3D
                platformer game complete with level design, enemies, and
                animation.

                The second unit features an “Escape The Maze” style game. With
                this project students will be introduced to fundamental concepts
                like materials, lighting, and creating a health system. We cover
                all the texture maps that make up a material and explain a basic
                3D art to game development workflow. Lighting topics include
                light types, direct vs indirect, emissive materials, and global
                illumination. We also build on our simple animated enemies from
                Unit 1 by creating AI driven enemies that chase the player
                around the maze!

                Intro to Unity’s midterm project is to create a Pong style game.
                The only real requirement is for the game to be playable, but
                students are encouraged to be creative and take liberties to
                express themselves. I’m very proud, and impressed, by what they
                came up with.

                For the third Unit we create a First Person Shooter game called
                “Zombie Hunter”. Here we study about character controllers,
                create a level with the terrain system, and write an audio
                manager to generate dynamic zombie sounds. We also learn how to
                create projectiles and shoot them with physics.

                The final project is to develop a Unity project of your
                choosing. Students can build off of one of our previous unit
                projects or follow a tutorial series online, but they must take
                it further and make it their own in some way. They can
                concentrate on one topic such as level design or coding, or
                choose to go for it and make a complete game. We’ve had some
                fantastic results and have even had students publish their games
                online such as the game Vertex Ball by former student

                  >John Sochacki</a
                >. John even created trailer for his game and made it free to
                play through his
