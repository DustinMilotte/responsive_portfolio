      <p class="bio-text">
        I was born in Utica, NY and raised in Knoxville, TN. I began my academic career as an Engineering student at the Univerity of Tennessee but being deeply involved in a musical project I switched my major to jazz studies and began performing and teaching in and around the southeastern US. Over the next 10 years I played in a variety of projects from progressive rock and jazz to funk and rap. During this time I worked as a Producer, Stage Manager, and Production Assistant for over 100 artists including Neil Young, Diana Ross, and Phish.

          In 2012 I decided to make a career change and entered the world of video production. Over the course of 5 years I worked my way up from Assistant Camera to Camera Operator and then to Second Unit Director and Director of Photography. Our crews produced shows for Discovery, Oxygen, TVOne, and Hallmark. We also made several commercials for a wide range of clients from US Cellular to Dollywood. In 2016 and 2017 I worked as a Camera Operator and Director of Photography for Scripps Network Interactive (HGTV, FoodNetwork). You can check out my

          I was introduced to Virtual Reality in 2016 and being thoroughly impressed and excited by the possibilities of immersive media, I decided I would devote myself to studying once again. I began by trading guitar lessons for coding lessons with a Software Engineer at Cisco and proceeded to complete several courses from Harvard's CS50 and The Complete Unity Developer to Blender Bootcamp and Zenva's VR Mini Degree. I am currently living in the NYC area and developing multiple XR projects for Autotelix. In 2019 I won <strong>Best Audio AR</strong> for my project <a href="zorblok.html">Riding With Zorblok</a> at the NYCXR Game Jam and served as <strong>Bose AR Developer</strong> for the mixed reality project <a href="loveseat.html">LOVESEAT</a> which premiered at the 2019 Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy.
